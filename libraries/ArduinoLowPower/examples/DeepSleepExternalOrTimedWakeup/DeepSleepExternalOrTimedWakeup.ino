   ArduinoLowPower deep sleep example with external or timed wakeup

   The example shows the basic usage of the Arduino Low Power library by putting the device into deep sleep.
   The device will remain in deep sleep until an external interrupt is triggered or the sleep timer expires.
   During deep sleep the whole device is powered down except for a minimal set of peripherals (like the Back-up RAM and RTC).
   This means that the CPU is stopped and the RAM contents are lost - the device will start from the beginning of the sketch after waking up.

   This example is compatible with all Silicon Labs Arduino boards.
