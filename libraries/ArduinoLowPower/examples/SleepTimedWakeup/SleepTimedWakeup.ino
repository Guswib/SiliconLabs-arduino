/*
   ArduinoLowPower timed sleep example

   The example shows the basic usage of the Arduino Low Power library by putting the device to sleep for a period of time.
   The device will enter sleep mode for 2000ms. During sleep the CPU is stopped but the RAM retains its contents.

   This example is compatible with all Silicon Labs Arduino boards.
